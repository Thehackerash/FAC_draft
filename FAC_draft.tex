\section{INTIAL DRAFT FOR THE FAC IIIT ALLAHABAD }


\begin{enumerate}
\item  IIIT ALLAHABAD IS A PLACE WITH GREAT POTENTIAL , WITH HAVING EXCEPTIONALLY TALENTED STUDENTS . \\
 BUT MAJORITY OF THE POTENTIAL IS POINTED TOWARDS A  POINT OF SINGULARITY , AS MOST OF CROWD IN THE COLLEGE SEEMS TO PURSUING THE SAME THING AND ENDS UP WORKING IN THE SAME DOMAIN . \\
IIIT ALLAHABAD IS CONSIDERED A “TIER -1” IN ALL TERMS CONSIDERING THE STUDENT POTENTIAL , INDUSTRY POTENTIAL AND PLACEMENT VALUE , BUT MAJORITY OF IT HAS BEEN LIMITED TO ONLY ONE JOB ROLE THAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING . 

\item  VARIOUS OTHER TIER – 1 COLLEGES , SUCH AS IITs  , BITS etc HAVE THEIR STUDENTS DIVE INTO VARIOUS FIELDS AND EXCEL IN THEM , THE CSE UNDERGRADS OF THESE COLLEGES HAVE EXCELLED IN MANY OTHER FIELDS SUCH AS CONSULTING , DATA SCIENCE , PRODUCT ROLES , FINANCE , QUANT FINANCE etc . 

\item THE IDEA OF SEETING UP AND STARTING THE FAC IS TO FORM A STUDENT COMMUNITY , WHICH WOULD DEVELOP A STRONG PROFILE TO BREAK INTO INDUSTRIES SUCH AS BUISNESS AND FINANCE . \\
AS A STUDENT IIITA IT IS KNOWN THAT OUR COLLEGE IS REALLY YOUNG , AND MANY THINGS ARE BEING CONSIDERED AND BUILT , WHERE AS OTHER COLLEGES BEING RESPECTIVELY OLDER THAN US HAVE THIS KINDS OF COMMUNITY PRESENT IN THEM SINCE A LONG TIME . 

\end{enumerate}
